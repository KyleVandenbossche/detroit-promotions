          More Than a Marketing Agency — A Movement for Meaningful Brands
        </h4>
        <p>
          I’m Kyrstyn Dean, a marketing strategist and business consultant passionate about helping brands grow and stand out digitally.
          With an MBA from Walsh College and 10+ years of experience in the corporate business world focused on various verticals such as
          Business Development, Account Management, Sales, Project Management, and Customer Success, I combine strategic thinking with creative execution
          to build strong brand identities and engaging media experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in branding, social media strategy, and content creation. I help businesses transform their online presence by crafting compelling campaigns,
          designing high-performing content, and developing cohesive marketing strategies that drive real results.
        </p>
        <p>
          With marketing experience across industries—healthcare and fitness—I understand how to align marketing efforts with business goals.
          I don’t just focus on aesthetics; I create data-driven strategies that enhance engagement, boost revenue, and build long-term brand loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether curating interactive digital marketing gift guides, designing social content tailored to a brand’s aesthetic,
          or consulting on brand direction, I thrive at the intersection of business and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not just a marketer—a strategist, problem solver, and brand architect, dedicated to helping companies make a lasting impact.

        <p>
          At Detroit Promotions, mentorship and education aren’t just buzzwords — they’re part of who we are.
          We know real-world skills like critical thinking and workforce readiness don’t always get enough spotlight in traditional classrooms.
          That’s why we’re committed to filling that gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re proud to share our experience and knowledge through meaningful partnerships that make a difference, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serving on the Macomb Community College Business Advisory Board</li>
          <li>Partnering with Walsh College’s Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship (CIE)</li>
          <li>Being the first business to pilot Walsh College’s Emerging Leader Program</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These programs aren’t just resume lines—they’re part of our mission to give back, pay it forward, and help others earn a seat at the table.

        <h3 className="fw-bold mb-3">Where It All Started</h3>
        <p>
          It all started in a high school business class—taught not by a teacher but by a local dentist with a knack for entrepreneurship.
          One summer, he called Kyrstyn and asked what she was doing over break. “Nothing,” she said. So he invited her to his office.
          That same day, she met the team, got a crash course in small business, and walked out with her very first job offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she nervously admitted she didn’t know anything about dentistry — and hadn’t even graduated high school yet — he said something that stuck:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="blockquote text-center" style={{ color: "9181CC" }}>
          “You’ve got character. I can teach you the rest.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          That moment changed everything. He taught her to lead with empathy, stay curious, and never underestimate the power of showing up with heart.
          That experience didn’t just shape her career — it shaped her purpose.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fw-bold mb-3">Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Now, that same spirit guides everything we do here. We believe growth is a team sport, mentorship matters,
          and marketing should feel more like a friendship than a formula.
