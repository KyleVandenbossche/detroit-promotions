          <p>
            It all started in a high school business class—taught not by a teacher but by a local dentist
            with a knack for entrepreneurship. One summer, he called Kyrstyn and asked what she was doing
            over break. “Nothing,” she said. So he invited her to his office. That same day, she met the
            team, got a crash course in small business, and walked out with her very first job offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she nervously admitted she didn’t know anything about dentistry — and hadn’t even graduated
            high school yet — he said something that stuck:
          </p>
          <blockquote
            className="blockquote text-center"
            style={{
              color: "#9181CC",                 // fixed missing '#'
              margin: "1rem auto",
              borderLeft: "4px solid #9181CC",
              paddingLeft: "0.75rem",
              maxWidth: 700,
            }}
          >
            “You’ve got character. I can teach you the rest.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            That moment changed everything. He taught her to lead with empathy, stay curious, and never
            underestimate the power of showing up with heart. That experience didn’t just shape her career —
            it shaped her purpose.

          <p>
            At Detroit Promotions, mentorship and education aren’t just buzzwords — they’re part of who
            we are. We know real-world skills like critical thinking and workforce readiness don’t always
            get enough spotlight in traditional classrooms. That’s why we’re committed to filling that gap.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re proud to share our experience and knowledge through meaningful partnerships that make a
            difference, including:
